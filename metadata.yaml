description: This uplifting novel penned by prominent Kentucky novelist James Lane
  Allen reminds readers that the most beautiful things in art and in life are often
  found in the most unexpected places. Young Ashby Truesdale has been blessed with
  a singing voice of remarkable purity and earnestness, but his family is mired in
  unspeakable poverty. Will he be able to overcome this hindrance to bring his creative
  gift to the world?
